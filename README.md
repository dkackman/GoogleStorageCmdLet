GoogleStorageCmdLet
===================

A PowerShell CmdLet for interacting with the [Google Storage API](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/json_api/) (similar in intent to their [gsutil](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/gsutil]) python utility)

Hopefully this will be useful for people who need to manage Google Storage in windows environments as part of application deployment or other back end tasks.
